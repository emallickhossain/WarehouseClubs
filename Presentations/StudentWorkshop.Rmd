### Motivation

* There are persistent differences between rich and poor households

### Big Picture
* Growing interest in income volatility, especially at a sub-annual level
* Could volatile income or volatile expenses generate this shopping behavior?
* How costly is this spending pattern over the course of a year?
* Should we refine welfare benefits as a result?

### Model Overview
* Each period, households purchase a "necessity" good and an outside good
* Utility is increasing in the outside good, conditional on consuming a minimum amount of the "necessity" good
* "Necessity" good is storable and can be purchased in different sizes
* Per-period income is fixed, but expenses are volatile
* **Question:** Would this model generate these different spending patterns? Under what conditions?
