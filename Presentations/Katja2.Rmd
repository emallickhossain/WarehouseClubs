### Price Index (Kaplan and Menzio 2014 / Aguiar and Hurst 2007)
* Different households may pay different prices for the same "good"
* **Goal**: Construct an index that enables comparison of expenditures across households
* Key choice is over the appropriate definition of "good"

### Price Index

\begin{align*}
X_{it} &= \sum_{j} P_{jit} q_{jit} \\
\bar{X}_{it} &= \sum_{j} \bar{P}_{jmt} q_{jit} \\
p_{it} &= \frac{X_{it}}{\bar{X}_{it}}
\end{align*}

* $P$ is the price paid for good $j$ by household $i$ at time $t$
* $\bar{P}$ is the average price of good $j$ in market $m$ at time $t$
* $q$ is the quantity of $j$ purchased by household $i$ at time $t$
* $X$ is total expenditures by household $i$ at time $t$
* $\bar{X}$ is household expenditures if purchased at the average market price
* $p$ is the relative price index for household $i$ at time $t$

### Price Index Takeaways
* Households making over \$50k are paying above average prices for the same good
* Households making less than \$50k are paying lower than average prices for the same good
* Gap has been increasing over time
