\caption*{Note: This table reports predicted package quantities purchased by households using model estimates of Equation (\ref{eq:mlogit}). Units are number of days the chosen package will last assuming average daily consumption rate of 57 2-ply sheets [@jaffe2007]. "No Storage" scenario imposes that no products incur storage costs for households. "Same Qty Pref." scenario imposes that all households have the same preferences for quantity as households making over \$100k. "Both" combines both scenarios.}
