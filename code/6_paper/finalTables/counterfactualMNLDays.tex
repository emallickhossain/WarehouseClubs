\caption*{Note: This table reports predicted package quantities purchased by households using model estimates of Equation (\ref{eq:mlogit}). Units are number of days the chosen package will last assuming average daily consumption rate of 57 two-ply sheets (Jaffe 2007). The "Unit Price Regs" scenario imposes unit price regulations everywhere. The "Rich Storage" scenario imposes that all households have the same preferences for "large" packages as households making over \$100k. Scenarios are cumulative.}
