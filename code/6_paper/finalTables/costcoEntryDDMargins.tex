\caption*{Notes: This table uses 2004--2015 Nielsen Consumer Panel data at the household-quarter level. Coefficients are reported for Equation (\ref{eq:costcoEntry}) which regresses households' quarterly bulk purchase shares on an indicator for warehouse club entry, household characteristics as well as household-ZIP code and year-quarter fixed effects are included. Column (1) uses bulk buying shares only at non-warehouse club stores as the dependent variable. Column (2) uses bulk buying shares at warehouse club stores (inclusive of zero spending quarters) as the dependent variable. Column (3) uses bulk buying shares at warehouse club stores (excluding zero spending quarters) as the dependent variable. Projection weights are not used.}
