\caption*{Notes: Using 2004--2017 Nielsen Consumer Panel data and state-level regulations, this table shows estimates of Equation \ref{eq:unitPriceMove} which regresses household bulk buying on unit price regulation after controlling for household fixed effects. "Regulation" denotes the estimated effect of moving from a state without regulation to a state with regulation. Column (3) allows for different types of moves. "Law to No Law" specifies a move from a state with unit price regulation to a state without unit price regulation. "No Law to Law" specifies a move from a state without unit price regulations to a state with unit price regulations. Standard errors are clustered at the household level.}
