\caption*{Notes: Using 2004--2017 Nielsen Consumer Panel data, this table reports summary statistics for the top 20 product categories by total spending. Annual spending is the average spending in that product category among households that purchased in that product category over the course of the year. Average price and average size are the average prices and sizes of products purchased in their corresponding category. All estimates are weighted using Nielsen's projection weights. Prices are in nominal 2017 dollars. Sizes are reported in common units for for that category (e.g. ounces for milk).}
