\caption*{Notes: This table uses 2004--2015 Nielsen Consumer Panel data at the household-quarter level. Coefficients are reported for Equation (\ref{eq:costcoEntry}) which regresses households' quarterly bulk purchase shares on an indicator for warehouse club entry, an indicator for whether the household shops at a warehouse club, and an interaction term as well as household demographics (household size, age, presence of children, and marital status). Household-ZIP code and year-quarter fixed effects are included. Standard errors are clustered at the household level and projection weights are not used.}
