Using over-the-month variation in liquidity (assuming more liquidity is available at the start of the month vs. the end), the authors find that low-income households buy TP in bulk when they have more liquidity, but this only explains 3-4% of the gap. It also finds similar evidence of increased bulk buying for other categories like paper towels, detergent, and cigarettes. My paper has an expanded scope, both in terms of products, and in terms of explanations. I look at bulk buying across a wide range of categories and explore a wide range of explanations. I only focus on toilet paper when I need to estimate my model.

They look at 4 kinds of discounting behavior (sales, bulk, outlet choice, and generic brands) for a wide range of food products using 2006 Homescan-style data in the UK. My paper is different because it expands to include non-food items. I also compute savings using actual quantities purchased, and explore the underlying reasons contributing to the difference in bulk purchasing. They also find a much smaller difference in bulk buying between income groups and a less monotonic relationship. This could be due to the focus on food products (I also find a smaller gap), but it could potentially be related to the setting. I focus on US grocery expenditures from 2004--2017 and they focus on UK grocery expenditures in 2006. They do highlight that bulk discounts are where households could save the most money (~224 pounds). They also only focus on overall baskets and don't look within stores.

This paper focuses on trends in discounting (generic, sales, bulk, outlets, and coupons) during the Great Recession. Their focus is on estimating the elasticity of substitution between time and market goods. They do find small differences in bulk buying between household income groups, but do not look at causes and only focus on food products. They use variation in shopping behavior and its implied discounts to back our their parameter of interest.

This paper explores the price differences between rich and poor neighborhoods in Buffalo and finds that poor neighborhoods face 2-5% higher prices after controlling for store size and competition and 10-15% without controlling for those factors. Car access is a key factor to search for consumers. The price indices were computed based on the price dispersion between stores and neighborhoods for identical goods. Overall, the sole focus is on price differences between stores and neighborhoods (access) and only focuses on a small geographic area. The focus is on search behavior between stores. Narrow in product scope (15 product categories), narrow in geography (1 market), no look at bulk discounts. They do find evidence that car access does limit household's ability to obtain lower prices. Not specific to bulk purchasing, but a similar logic would apply. My paper is national in scope and documents inequality even within stores.

This paper documents evidence that bulk discounts exist on a wide range of items from the UK's household survey of food expenditures. He has to use an IV to convincingly identify the discount (i.e. quantity discount elasticity) while I can directly observe the prices and quantities from the Scanner data. He finds that poor households pay less than average for their basket even with quantity discounts, but he is likely overstating the inequality because he cannot control for quality differences. Less than average is really not the key here. They still are missing out on savings because they don't buy in bulk. Broad(ish) in scope, but does not include non-food items, but focused on UK. Bulk buying for food is also weakened because bulk buying perishable items may be a poor idea.

This paper explores price differences between stores in rich and poor neighborhoods in the Twin Cities area of Minnesota. They find that chain stores have lower prices than independent stores, but that the poor pay higher prices because they have less access to chain stores since these outlets do not locate in low-income areas. (This is similar to Talukdar 2008 in finding this sorting of stores). This study primarily focused on food. Narrow in scope (55 product categories) and narrow in geography (Twin Cities area), does not focus on bulk.

This paper documents the price differences that can be attributed to differences in store types (independent stores tend to charge higher prices) and product sizes (bulk discounts reduce prices for large items). Based on a small survey of of 159 New Haven households, they find some rudimentary evidence that package sizes increase with income and household size and that poor households are likely to cite storage and budget as making them buy smaller packages even though they are aware of bulk discounts. There was also evidence of transportation costs since most middle-income households used cars while only half of low-income households used cars. This is narrow in scope (8 products [not even categories]) and narrow in geography (New Haven only). My paper is broad in geography and product scope. It also explicitly incorporates awareness of unit prices and storage in its estimation separate from a survey.

This article provides a nice overview of the literature. Most early studies were surveys of whether households were aware of unit prices and they found that awareness increased with income and education. Then, there were some experimental studies that were small-scale and examined how sales changed when unit prices were presented and they found mixed results. Overall, price lists (which are uncommon) had the highest response. This paper leverages differences in unit price presentation between two retailers, but they do field surveys at a public rail station to see who pays attention to them and a lab experiment using 66 passengers at an airport terminal (clearly pre-9/11) and they find that prominence matters. They mention that a patchwork of state level regulations exists, but don't do anything with that.

Examine 6 stores within the same chain in Milwaukee (1 test and 1 control in low, middle, and high-income areas) and look at 13 product categories.

Field experiment at 2 Safeway stores in 6 product categories. Did 4-week interventions with unit prices, unit price lists and reverting back to the old system. Posting unit prices reduced spending by 1% and putting in an organized list reduced spending by 3%. In 1977, the cost of unit pricing was about 0.1% of sales, but given tech advances, the variable costs should be negligible over the current costs of posting prices and fixed costs should be small.

This is a nice overview of the myriad of ways that low-income households pay for for everyday items. They find low income households pay more for the following:
* Check cashing and payday loans: ~1-10% fee on check value for cashing and up to 15% fee for a loan
* Tax refund service: Pay 70-1800% to get a tax refund advance loan
* Remittances: Paying to send money to other countries
* Cars: Pay $50-500 more for the exact same car
* Car loans: Pay ~2 pp more on car loans
* Car insurance: Pay $50-1000 more on car insurance
* Home loans: Pay 1pp more on home loans
* Home insurance: Pay $300 more on home insurance
* Durables: Often pay for rent-to-own instead of just buying the item. A $200 TV costs $700 at a rent to own after interest

This paper examines purchase diary history of about 500 Chicago households in 1961 for 31 products. They find a postive relationship between package size and income, household size, education, and look at some other HH characteristics.

Lab experiment of 200 housewives. They find that providing unit price information affects which package sizes of detergent and soft drinks people buy even when they adjust the price schedule to either be linear, quantity discount, or quantity surcharge. People adjust appropriately (but not as much as you might think).

Primarily a survey that finds that many consumers find it costly to compute unit prices and there is evidence that they find it difficult to use as well. More highly educated and older people use unit prices (at least in the UK). Some responses suggested that many households use the volume discount heuristic and some are opposed to spending so much or locking up money in big packages. 59% felt this form of pricing was unfair.

Consumers use a wide range of strategies when choosing what to buy when unit prices are not posted.

Focus on a limited set of products (Dutch detergent and IRI detergent, razors, shampoo, and diapers) and focus on quantity surcharges. In the Netherlands, unit pricing has been in effect since 1998. They specifically mention (p. 360) that they "are not aware of any work that has disaggregated products by size..." and then mention that most papers have focused on a single size or aggregated to the brand level by taking an average.

Do a consumer education intervention and find that education does reduce expenditures relative to households with no education intervention. Done in Australia where unit pricing is almost universal. Tracked 302 households over 20 weeks. The only dependent variable was average spending per item based on receipts mailed back by households, so it's receipt total / # of items, which may or may not be a good measure. Assuming the same items are purchased each week, then this might be okay. Find evidence that education around unit pricing helps reduce expenditures, but there are some issues with the generalizability of the study.
