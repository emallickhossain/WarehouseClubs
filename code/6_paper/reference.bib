This paper explores the price differences between rich and poor neighborhoods in Buffalo and finds that poor neighborhoods face 2-5% higher prices after controlling for store size and competition and 10-15% without controlling for those factors. Car access is a key factor to search for consumers. The price indices were computed based on the price dispersion between stores and neighborhoods for identical goods.

This paper documents evidence that bulk discounts exist on a wide range of items from the UK's household survey of food expenditures. He has to use an IV to convincingly identify the discount (i.e. quantity discount elasticity) while I can directly observe the prices and quantities from the Scanner data. He finds that poor households pay less for their basket even with quantity discounts, but he is likely overstating the inequality because he cannot control for quality differences.

This paper explores price differences between stores in rich and poor neighborhoods in the Twin Cities area of Minnesota. They find that chain stores have lower prices than independent stores, but that the poor pay higher prices because they have less access to chain stores since these outlets do not locate in low-income areas. This study primarily focused on food.

This paper documents the price differences that can be attributed to differences in store types (independent stores tend to charge higher prices) and product sizes (bulk discounts reduce prices for large items). Based on a small survey of of 159 New Haven households, they find that package sizes increase with income and household size and that poor households are likely to cite storage and budget as making them buy smaller packages even though they are aware of bulk discounts. There was also evidence of transportation costs since most middle-income households used cars while only half of low-income households used cars.

This paper shows that while food expenditures decline at retirement, the quantity and quality of food consumed are not changed. This is because households spend more time shopping and cooking at home as a way to reduce their expenditures.
